3D animated graphics using the REGIS protocol


This sends graphics over a serial port.
This also shows how to do 3D graphics in pure software.


genmodel.py generates the models which are plotted.  The need to
optimize the number of polylines makes it hard to import an STL file.

3d.C:
3d_arduino.ino:
Compile & run 3d.C on X86_64 or 3d_arduino.ino on Arduino to find out
how far you can go on 8 bits.

Uncomment a loop line & recompile to see a different model
//    cube_loop();
//    icos_loop();
    gear_loop();

It's configured for a 480x480 resolution screen, which is what xterm
defaults to.

To set or delete a new terminal resolution:
    echo 'xterm*regisScreenSize:640x480' | xrdb -merge
    echo 'xterm*regisScreenSize' | xrdb -remove
Start a new xterm after xrdb.

To run it on an Arduino, upload it with the IDE, then in xterm:
stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 ispeed 115200
cat /dev/ttyACM0

It doesn't work inside screen or minicom.  A few REGIS features don't
work in xterm, like macrographs.  The graphics aren't drawn in realtime,
but only when exiting REGIS mode.
